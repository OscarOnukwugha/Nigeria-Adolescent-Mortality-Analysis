## Project Overview:
This project analyzes adolescent mortality trends in Nigeria between 2000 and 2021, highlighting the leading causes and their changing patterns over the years.
The goal was to understand how health outcomes among adolescents have evolved, identify the most prevalent causes of death, and generate insights that can inform public health strategies and policy interventions.

#### Data was goten from UNICEF website.

## Objective
- To examine adolescent mortality data across Nigeria (2000–2021) and uncover:
- The total and yearly distribution of adolescent deaths.
- The major causes contributing to mortality.
- The trend patterns over time and how different causes fluctuate across decades.
- Data-driven recommendations to support public health planning.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tool Used: 
Microsoft Excel & Power BI
### Methodology:
- Cleaned and structured mortality data for analysis.
- Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, causes, and distribution patterns.
- Created year and cause filters for dynamic exploration of insights.
- Performed comparative analysis across four time ranges: 2000–2004, 2005–2009, 2010–2015, and 2016–2021.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Mortality Overview
- Total Adolescent Mortality Recorded: 1.46 million (2000–2021)
- Highest Annual Mortality: 73,000 (in 2021)
- Leading Cause: Other Communicable Diseases - 345,130 deaths (23.71%)
2. Mortality Trend (2000–2021)
- There has been an upward trend in adolescent mortality, rising from 63K in 2000 to 73K in 2021.
- The steady increase highlights the persistent health burden within the adolescent population.
3. Top 5 Causes of Adolescent Mortality:
- Other Communicable Diseases	
- Malaria	                    
- Diarrhea	                  
- Tuberculosis	
- Other NCDs	
### Solution applied: 
To address this, I identified all records under 18 as outliers, supported by their significantly lower count compared to other age groups. I then grouped these records with the 18-25 age bracket, as it is the closest and most reasonable category for such cases. This approach ensures data consistency and accuracy.

### Key Insights:
- The most popular content type is news, closely followed by movies and short videos.

- Excessive notifications contribute to social media fatigue, affecting user well-being.

- Highly tech-savvy users prefer Smart TVs and tablets.

- Smartphone and PC usage is balanced across different user categories.

- Tech-savvy users consume more educational content, whereas others prefer entertainment.

- Professionals have the highest reading engagement.
  
- Students and unemployed individuals also dedicate substantial time to reading.

- Single users read more compared to married or widowed individuals.
  

## Recommendations:

- Platform-Specific Marketing: The audience breakdown shows that advertisers should focus on TikTok and Instagram toward younger viewers and use Facebook and YouTube for reaching older demographics.
  
ii. Given the nearly equal preference for all platforms, advertising on multi-platform is important.

- Improving Digital Well-being: To reduce social media fatigue level, users should embrace using "Do Not Disturb" features more often.

- Content Strategy Optimization: The platforms should dedicate resources to develop short-form news content and interactive video features because users strongly favor these formats.
  
ii. Subscription services need to establish multiple pricing plans that target users from different income groups.

- Digital Literacy Improvement: Educational content promotion must focus specifically on users who lack technological sophistication.
  
- Enhancing User Experience via Internet Speed: Streaming platforms need to improve how they distribute content to users who experience slow internet speeds.

# Conclusion:

The dashboard system generates important data which helps users make decisions about user behaviors and digital content use as well as productivity levels and content participation metrics. The excessive screen time along with social media fatigue indicates people are too dependent on digital entertainment. Digital platforms need to establish entertainment-productivity equilibrium through demographic analysis for personalized user experiences.

Digital literacy along with mindful consumption and strategic content delivery emerges as essential elements for today's growing online engagement.
