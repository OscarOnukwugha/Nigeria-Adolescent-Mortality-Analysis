## Project Overview:
This project analyzes adolescent mortality trends in Nigeria between 2000 and 2021, highlighting the leading causes and their changing patterns over the years.
The goal was to understand how health outcomes among adolescents have evolved, identify the most prevalent causes of death, and generate insights that can inform public health strategies and policy interventions.

#### Data was goten from UNICEF website.

## Objective
- To examine adolescent mortality data across Nigeria (2000–2021) and uncover:
- The total and yearly distribution of adolescent deaths.
- The major causes contributing to mortality.
- The trend patterns over time and how different causes fluctuate across decades.
- Data-driven recommendations to support public health planning.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tool Used: 
Microsoft Excel & Power BI
### Methodology:
- Cleaned and structured mortality data for analysis.
- Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, causes, and distribution patterns.
- Created year and cause filters for dynamic exploration of insights.
- Performed comparative analysis across four time ranges: 2000–2004, 2005–2009, 2010–2015, and 2016–2021.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Mortality Overview
- Total Adolescent Mortality Recorded: 1.46 million (2000–2021)
- Highest Annual Mortality: 73,000 (in 2021)
- Leading Cause: Other Communicable Diseases - 345,130 deaths (23.71%)
2. Mortality Trend (2000–2021)
- There has been an upward trend in adolescent mortality, rising from 63K in 2000 to 73K in 2021.
- The steady increase highlights the persistent health burden within the adolescent population.

3. Top 5 Causes of Adolescent Mortality:
- Other Communicable Diseases	
- Malaria	                    
- Diarrhea	                  
- Tuberculosis	
- Other NCDs
4. Cause Analysis by Period
- 2000–2009: Other Communicable Diseases dominated mortality causes, followed by Malaria and Diarrhea.
- 2010–2015: Tuberculosis began to emerge significantly, overtaking Diarrhea in contribution.
- 2016–2021: Malaria and Other Communicable Diseases remained top causes, but Tuberculosis continued to rise, indicating a shift in disease dynamics.

## Recommendations
- Invest in communicable disease control programs targeting adolescents, especially focusing on malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrhea.
- Improve access to adolescent healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where preventable deaths remain high.
- Enhance disease surveillance systems to provide real-time monitoring and faster response to outbreaks.
- Promote health education in schools to increase awareness of hygiene, nutrition, and preventive care.
- Strengthen data collection mechanisms to ensure accurate mortality reporting and inform evidence-based policymaking.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals a concerning upward trend in adolescent mortality over the past two decades, with communicable diseases remaining the primary threat.
Addressing this issue requires sustained investment in healthcare infrastructure, prevention programs, and adolescent-focused interventions.
By leveraging data analytics, policymakers can make informed decisions that help reduce mortality rates and promote healthier futures for Nigeria’s youth.
